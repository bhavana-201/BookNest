## ✨ What is BookNest?

## 🧠 Inspiration

> "Less screen time, more book time."  
> BookNest was born from the need for a minimalist, no-frills book tracking tool to focus on offline status, consistency and reading goals.
> BookNest stands out by doing less so you can read more. Just track, update, and unplug.
